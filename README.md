angular-seedling
================

Base app for Neosavvy Angular JS projects. 

To use this seedling project and see it work just execute the following two commands
on any MacOS system.

```
npm install
grunt
```

Expectations are that you have SASS and Ruby installed. The build will fail if you don't.

    # ruby is installed by default! If you lack it - somehow you broke it

```
gem install sass
```

## Requirements Pulled in Via Bower

We don't think you have to use all these libraries for your project, but we have battle tested this stack in several production environments. Conclusion: it's nice.

```
//Production
angular
angular-animate
angular-cookies
angular-route
angular-cookies
angular-loader
angular-cache
angular-sanitize
foundation 4
jQuery
jQuery.XDomainRequest /* For IE8, 9 requests */
lodash
momentjs
neosavvy-javascript-angular-core
neosavvy-javascript-core
node-uuid
numeral
q
underscore.string

//Dev

```

We appreciate your use, forks, and pull requests.
