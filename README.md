angular-seedling
================

Base app for Neosavvy Angular JS projects. 

To use this seedling project and see it work just execute the following two commands
on any MacOS system.


    # npm install
    # grunt

Expectations are that you have SASS and Ruby installed. The build will fail if you don't.

    # ruby is installed by default! If you lack it - somehow you broke it
    # gem install sass
